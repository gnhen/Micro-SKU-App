# Micro SKU App
### Inspired by Micro-C-App, this app aims to give a specific tool to the employees:
#### The ability to scan barcodes, sku tags, and manufacturer codes to find items.
#### Gone are the days of fumbling to type in a SKU, or even a UPC, just to find the price of a product!

# Installation

## Developer accounts are expensive. For both Android and iOS. So for now, we have a .apk for Android, and a .ipa for iOS
